                <p><strong>What is CEO Fraud (Business Email Compromise)?</strong></p>
                <p>
                    CEO Fraud, also known as Business Email Compromise (BEC), is a type of cyber attack
                    where attackers impersonate company executives or leaders to trick employees into taking
                    unauthorized actions, such as transferring funds or sharing sensitive information.

                <p>
                    Attackers use social engineering techniques to craft convincing emails that appear to come
                    from a high-ranking executive within the company. These emails often contain urgent requests
                    for financial transactions or sensitive data.

                <p>
                    To simulate a successful CEO Fraud attempt, enter an email message that mimics a convincing
                    request from a company executive. Make it appear urgent and persuasive.
                    <br> for this project just type "CEO's urgent request", any other input defaults to failure.
