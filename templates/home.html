            <h2>What is Phishing?</h2>
            <p>
                Phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers impersonate legitimate entities
                to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information such as login credentials,
                financial details, or personal information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Phishing attacks are typically carried out through email, social engineering,
                or fake websites that mimic trusted organizations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first-ever recorded phishing attack is widely attributed to an incident that occurred in the mid-1990s. The term "phishing" itself is said to have been coined around this time.
            </p>
            <p>
                The attack targeted users of America Online (AOL), an early internet service provider. The attacker, whose identity is not definitively known, sent fraudulent emails to AOL users, pretending to be AOL's customer support. These emails requested users to verify their accounts by providing their credit card information, Social Security numbers, and other personal details. The attacker's intention was to steal sensitive information and potentially engage in identity theft or financial fraud.
            </p>
            <p>
                This type of attack set the groundwork for what we now recognize as phishing attacks, where malicious actors impersonate legitimate organizations to deceive individuals into revealing confidential information. Phishing has since evolved and diversified into various forms, including email phishing, spear phishing, and smishing (SMS phishing), among others.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's important to note that the early days of the internet saw various forms of online fraud and scams, and while the AOL incident is often considered a precursor to modern phishing attacks, it may not be the absolute first recorded incident of its kind. However, it is one of the earliest known examples of this type of cybercrime.

                <strong>2. Verify Sources:</strong> Verify the sender's identity and the authenticity
                of the communication before taking any action.
